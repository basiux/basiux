# General

## Goals
### Why do you apply for Kickstart Accelerator? What are the main goals you want to achieve?

basiux have one goal. to build "the super intelligence" (let's call it, ai for short). having half of our prototype, we still need to start this up, for which this program would mean a lot to us!

our next milestone is to build ai4schools, a system to teach some basic blocks of such ai (namely how neural networks work) to kids (thus, anyone), because everybody needs to better understand ai. in practice it's a game played by an ai with a visual representation of its neural network, so we can watch it growing from zero and understand how the machine learns (which actually tells a lot about our own brain).

during those 3 months, we hope being able to make the mvp even without a prototype. we want to focus on selling the idea to schools, probably in the UK or (now) in Swiss.

# Company & Product

## Executive Summary
### Please give an executive summary of your company. [max. 200 words]

formed in 2015 as a studying project in a field with almost no players trying to elaborate a practical roadmap. we were able to build a proof of concept prototype but in 2016 the company came to a hiatus for the whole year. it's still paused and hoping to find new strength and rise up.

## Problem / Solution
### Describe the problem you are solving and why your solution is the right one to solve it. How are people solving it currently (without your product/service)? [max. 200 words]

intelligence is arguably the most complex topic we as human beings need to resolve as soon as possible. the unlikely dangers it may impose by itself (as media loves to point) I believe is an actually irrelevant aspect. we strive for the uncountable problems it can help to resolve, including the imminent human-race-as-we-know-it extermination through unexpected and highly probable events such as global warming or meteor impact. nobody knows the right solution to any of this. we must follow our guts and go with whatever makes sense to each one of us. but need to be properly informed first.

ai4schools comes as a first step into trying to make the human race understand ai more broadly, in a fun and unique way, to allow the knowledge to spread.

# Team

## Co-founders / Core Team
### Please introduce your team including roles and explain why you have all the necessary skills and experience in your team? Who has which expertise in which domain / business area? [max. 200 words]

caue, programmer and some business skills;
maira, journalist and communication specialist;
luiara, teacher and business consultant;
gustavo, entrepreneur and ui/ux designer;

we all strongly believe education is the core foundation of society and ai will become ubiquitous. ai4schools is an ambitious project which needs people who agree with this vision. the team is growing and will get bigger before we have all needed to ignite the project.

## Team History
### How did you meet your co-founders? How long have you been working together? [max. 200 words]

maira is my wife for 8 years now and she helps me with the communication whenever she can. luiara is my sister and gustavo my childhood friend. we've been working on this for almost 3 years now, since basiux foundation. basically, they support me in whichever endeavor I get myself in. most of the practical work have been polishing up the idea, some prototype building and pitching in some places such as lisbon startup pirates, london google campus and portuguese shark tank pre-screening.

## Start With Why
### Why did you start this company? What excites you about it? [max. 200 words]

the impossible: change everything. everything. any technology that's too advanced for one's own knowledge is indistinguishable from magic. this is the first and only time I can recall I came to believe in real wizardry - *perhaps* initially not as big as dr strange or matrix rediscovering reality, but certainly much, much bigger and faster than transcendence or her.

how can this not excite anyone?!

I can't say I've realized all my dreams, but I also never had one which was such a life goal as this. I had nothing before that excites me as much as basiux. I literally went crazy about it.

# Traction & Potential

## Product Validation
### What steps have you taken to validate the product with users? Please specify. [max. 200 words]

talking to people. built the basiux website, looking for ordinary user's feedback.

## Business Model Validation
### Is your business model based on assumptions or validated facts? Please specify. [max. 200 words]

assumptions. we want to find schools willing to finance it. whoever chooses to do so, we'll spend time tailoring it with them. the beta version is exclusive for selected partners.

## Competitor Analysis
### Who are your competitors? Who might become a competitor in the future? What differentiates your company from your competitors? [max. 200 words]

the road to the super ai got two big names we're aware and who are independently aligned with our vision: open ai and neuralink. deepmind is doing similar research but apparently with different goals. almost everyone else like ibm or facebook who focus almost all their efforts on commercial results. and then the ones as wolfram and miri who are going through different routes, like most of other smaller players along with us.

in basiux we believe the one thing standing between now and the singularity is an algorithm able to harvest the web knowledge and computer power. and nobody we came across is trying to do that. especially nobody trying to teach ai to kids.

## USP
### What makes you stand out from your competitors? [max. 200 words]

nobody is trying to do a game kids can enjoy playing while learning ai concepts without even knowing they're doing so.

picture a tamagotchi. now instead of feeding it, it's mario! and you have to teach it how to play its own game. while you do so, you can see his brain connections getting complex, connecting inputs (the screen and the player) with outputs (the keypad). it will continue trying even if you do nothing, and probably die miserably so. but it'll learn if you teach it enough. and you can share how good your mario is with your friends. save any state, try again. etc.

## Customer Acquisition
### How will you get users/customers? If your business faces a chicken-and-egg problem, how do you overcome that? (e.g. it won't be attractive to users till it has a lot of users like marketplace, dating site, ad network) [max. 200 words]

the stable version will always be free. get kids interested in playing it. we need enough pockets to do so until we get to the schools and if we can sell this to you, KA, and make the mvp during those 3 months, that means we may already have got enough traction to continue working on it for as long as needed with our current family chain support and no need for extra costs until we can get to a first customer.

## Revenue Model
### What is your revenue model? [max. 200 words]

if not schools we may still be able to keep it donation based, wikipedia wise. similar models could work, but it's fundamental to keep the company goal in mind and maintain it always open source and free.

## Execution Plan
### What are your main challenges for the next 12 months and how do you plan to solve them? [max. 200 words]

for a long time the main challenge will be financing. and we'll keep applying for any program that makes enough sense like this but, above all, we'll keep the team to people who can pay their own bills with their own support or pockets until we can get our first client. hardcore bootstrapping, since we don't believe this project has a place in any business market.

# Finance & Funding

## Revenues
### Please indicate your revenues to date. [max. 200 words]

none.

## Investments
### How much money have you already raised? Please indicate the rounds (Seed, Series A, Series B, etc.) and currencies as well as the investors (if you can disclose them). [max. 200 words]

no rounds. nothing raised. if we count initial time invested of 1 resource (me) for about 6 months with any extra costs, including food, rent and things such as health and logistics, we could calculate spending an average around € 12k at most, without taxes.

## Runway
### With your current burn rate when are you going to run out of money without securing any additional funds? [max. 200 words]

have ran out already (main reason for the 2016 hiatus).

## Capital Requirements
### What are your capital requirements over the next 24 months and for what do you need the money? [max. 200 words]

supposing we are not accepted here and without any growth considered, to keep the 1 resource full time (essential to keep it going) we would need € 48k without taxes. but if we get accepted and can not find this kind of funding, as implied elsewhere, we may be able to reduce this cost to near zero through family support. on another side, we could use up to € 192k to include 3 more people while anything beyond that would probably be unnecessary or even harmful until we can close the first couple of deals.

# Legal & Risks

## Non-compete / IP Agreements
### Are any of the founders covered by noncompete or intellectual property agreements that overlap with your project? If so, please explain. [max. 200 words]

nope. the goal is full opensource and excruciating transparency.

## Other Important Stuff
### Is there anything else we should know about your company? (e.g. pending lawsuits, co-founders who have left, etc.) [max. 200 words]

sorry, company too new and small to have any such history!

## Regulatory Restrictions
### Are there any regulatory restrictions surrounding your business? [max. 200 words]

none we are aware of.

## Outsourcing
### Do you have any parts of your business outsourced? [max. 200 words]

we'd only wish. perhaps soon.

## Supplier Risk
### Are you heavily dependend on suppliers? If yes, how do you mitigate the supplier risk? [max. 200 words]

not now or in any foreseeable future.

## IP & Protection
### How do you protect your idea? How do you retain a competitive advantage? [max. 200 words]

nobody seem to believe in it! :D
you have to laugh...
let's just say there are many more ideas where this one came from.
